										<h1>Raspberry Pi</h1>
									</header>

									<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.
										The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of HDMI and USB devices.
									</p>
									<p>Check out some of our projects below to get inspired, and enroll youself for a whole day training, to learn the basic of electronics and python programming. No prior knowledge of programing or electronics is required to attend the one day workshop.

										<h3>Hidden Camera</h3>
										<p>If you ever have the need of Hidden camera for your office, use a Pi and one of the latest Pi camera modules. For the software
											we are using motionEyeOS which turns your Pi into a surveillance device, and you can also trigger other things
											in your house like a speaker or lights to scare the intruder. In our case, as part of the project we are using
											 IFTTT to turn on my Phillips HUE lights at home and send an email of intrusion detection.  </p>

									<h2>Raspberry Pi Workshop </h2>
									<h5>Duration: 14 hours (2 Days)</h5>
									<p>This course is an introduction to the Raspberry Pi platform. It uses the Raspberry Pi Zero W. It is catered for all levels and those interested in learning about the Raspberry Pi and its capabilities. As this is a beginner level course, no prior knowledge of programming or electronics is required to start. If you are a hobbyist, a teacher, or an absolute beginner who wants to get introduced to the world of physical computing using the Raspberry Pi, this fully self-contained course is meant for you.</p>
									<p>By the end of the course, you will get deep insights into the hardware features of the Raspberry Pi 4.
