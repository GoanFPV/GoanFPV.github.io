            <p>
              The Internet Of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical
              objects, so known as, "things" — that are embedded with sensors,
              software, and other technologies that are used for the purpose of
              connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over
              the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple
              technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, ubiquitous
              computing, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional
              fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control
              systems, automation (including home and building automation), all
              contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer
              market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining
              to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and
              appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security
              systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one
              or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices
              associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart
              speakers.

                <h3>Plant Monitoring using AWS IoT</h3>
                <p>
                  Build yourself a plant monitoring and notification system with
                  the following feature - Monitor the Temperature, Light Value,
                  and Soil moisture value using Amazon IoT service to log data
                  to AWS - DynamoDB and then use AWS -SNS notification, to send
                  out an email to yourself, so that you can inform your
                  cousin/neighbor to quickly water the plant or check on your
                  thermostat at home. In addition, we have designed a 3D printed
                  enclosure, to house the Arduino Yun, grove shield, and
                  sensors.

                <p>
                  This project is inspired by the Mars Curiosity Rover, I don't
                  expect this rover to make it to Mars! but you can mimic it and
                  implement some cool features using the Intel Edison board.
                  Having said that, on mother Earth you can find industrial
                  applications for this, to monitor the hazardous conditions.

                  1010 + Env Shield to post sensor data like temperature,
                  humidity, UV index to the Arduino IoT Cloud, which was still
                  in Beta testing when writing the blog.

              Please note, the price for the two-day workshop does NOT include
              refreshments, and space to conduct the workshop. As a suggestion
              for the Workshop space, and something that has worked in the past,
              is to have your parents/guardian speak to the school
              teacher/principal to get the computer lab for the weekend/holiday.
              In addition, this price is available only for Goa, for neighboring
              States please get in touch via email.

              Here is the list of Hardware required, if you plan on doing the
              practicals in the Workshop, a suggestion here is to have at least
              2/3 students contribute and buy the hardware.

            <h4>Price: Rs 1200 per student, for a minimum of 10 students, please inquire about a discount if you have taken one of are Raspberry Pi Workshops</h4>
            <p>
              Please note, the price for the two-day workshop does NOT include
              refreshments, and space to conduct the workshop. As a suggestion
              for the Workshop space, and something that has worked in the past,
              is to have your parents/guardian speak to the school
              teacher/principal to get the computer lab for the weekend/holiday.
              In addition, this price is available only for Goa, for neighboring
              States please get in touch via email.
