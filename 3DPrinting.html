										<h1>3D Printing</h1>
									</header>

									<p>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD (computer-aided design) model or a digital 3D model.
										The term "3D printing" can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control to
										create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused together),
										typically layer by layer.
									</p>
									<p>Check out some of our projects below to get inspired, and enroll youself for a whole day training, to learn the basic of electronics. No prior knowledge of programing or electronics is required to attend the one day workshop.
									</p>
									<p>In addition we also offer a 3D printing service using PLA or ABS filaments of various colors, please refer to the section below on how you can send your STL files you want to print. Or you can upload/choose a
										STL file from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/"> Thingiverse</a>, or any other equivalent STL uploading website.

										<h3>Book Reading Ring</h3>
										<p>This ring will help you hold a book in one hand while you enjoy a hot cup of tea/coffee with the other hand. So 3D print the STL file attached,
											 which matches your thumb size and pick up your favorite Novel and read in bed comfortably without straining your thumb..</p>

										<h3>LED Christmas tree</h3>
										<p>This is a great way to modify and add that extra wow! factor to your christmas holiday wreath that hangs outside your front door. Here we are using an Arduino MKR1000, NeoPixels, and a buzzer.
											 And we also get notified via SMS/email when someone is at the door. Also add a piezo buzzer to play your favorite holiday tune. Add a PIR sensor to detect motion in front of the door, this will trigger the NeoPixels on the wreath and play a tune.</p>

										<h3>Touch based musical speaker- Conductive PLA</h3>
										<p>Creating music is always fun, but making it with your own DIY musical instrument is much better !! Now if you have one of the BOSEBuild speaker cube and have access to a 3D printer, then this project is something you should try.
											In addition to a 3D printer and conductive filament, you will also need a few electronic components which include the Raspberry Pi Zero W and Adafruit's Capacitive touch Pi Hat.</p>
