            <p>
              3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a
              three-dimensional object from a Computer-Aided Design(CAD) model
              or a digital 3D model. The term "3D printing" can refer to a
              variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined, or
              solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional
              object, with the material being added together (such as plastics,
              liquids, or powder grains being fused together), typically layer
              by layer.

              Check out some of our projects below to get inspired, and enroll
              yourself for a whole day of training, to learn the basics of 3D
              design and printing. No prior knowledge of 3D design or
              electronics is required to attend the one day workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we also offer a 3D printing service using PLA or ABS
              filaments of various colors, please refer to the section below on
              how you can send the STL files you want to print. Or you can
              upload/choose an STL file from
              <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/"> Thingiverse</a>, or any
              other equivalent STL uploading website.

                <h3>Book Reading Ring</h3>
                <p>
                  This ring will help you hold a book in one hand while you
                  enjoy a hot cup of tea/coffee with the other hand. So 3D print
                  the STL file attached, which matches your thumb size and pick
                  up your favourite Novel and read in bed comfortably without
                  straining your thumb.

                  This is a great Christmas holiday project, that involves 3D
                  printing and some basic electronics, with 5 LEDs and a 9V
                  battery at the base of the tree. You can place the Mini
                  Christmas tree on your study table or stick it on your front
                  door.

                  Creating music is always fun, but making it with your own
                  musical instrument is even more fun!! Now if you have one of
                  the BOSE Build speaker cube and have access to a 3D printer,
                  then this project is something you should try. In addition to
                  a 3D printer and conductive filament, you will also need a few
                  electronic components which include the Raspberry Pi Zero W
                  and Adafruit's Capacitive touch Pi Hat.
